    <h1>node-red-contrib-hs100</h1>

    <p>This Node-RED node is for controlling tp-link Wi-Fi Smart Plug - Model HS100.</p>

    <p>This node has only been tested with a HS100(UK). The HS100 is also available in US and EU plug versions. We expect they will work too.</p>

    <p>This node simply wraps the excellent work here <a href="https://github.com/czjs2/hs100-api">https://github.com/czjs2/hs100-api</a>. </p>

    <h1>Configuration</h1>

    <p>Drag this node on to a worksheet and double click it. Enter the IP address of the plug on your network. Save and deploy.</p>

    <p>If the message property 'hs100_address' is set it will <strong>override</strong> whatever is set in the Address field on the node's configuration screen.</p>

    <h1>Actuation</h1>

    <h2>Turn on</h2>

    <p>To turn the HS100 on, send a message to this node's input with the topic or payload set to <code>on</code>.</p>

    <h2>Turn off</h2>

    <p>To turn the HS100 off, send a message to this node's input with the topic or payload set to <code>off</code>.</p>

    <h2>Obtain power consumption data</h2>

    <p>To obtain the power consumption, send a message to this node's input with the topic or payload set to `consumption`. The consumption data will
    be sent via this node's output in <code>msg.payload</code>.</p>
